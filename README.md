# US COVID-19 Drug Therapy Risk Prediction

![](Resource_Deployment/img/banner.png)

# About this repository
The US COVID-19 Drug Therapy Risk Prediction Solution Accelerator is an end-to-end analytics platform that predicts the likelihood of a patient to experience a fatal adverse event (death) after receiving drug therapy for COVID-19.  The solution incorporates real-world data from the [State Drug Utilization Database](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/state-drug-utilization-data/index.html) (SDUD) and the [FDA Adverse Events Database](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/fda-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers) (FAERS).   

The solution uses the SDUD data to first build a retrospective analysis to identify drug prescription trends between the years 2018-2021, particularly during the onset of COVID-19 in 2019.  Next, a prospective analysis looks at FDA adverse events associated with these drugs between 2019-2021.  A machine learning (ML) model is built to predict the likelihood of a fatal adverse event, and identify the patient characteristics associated with this outcome.    

The solution can be used in a provider organization covering multiple personas, ranging from backend engineers to frontend clinical users.    For technical organizations, a Data Engineer can quickly ingest SDUD and FAERS data through a low-code, no-code experience. A Data Architect can use a flexible, scalable analytics platform to query a data lake, anonymize sensitive patient information, and generate operational reports using familiar SQL language.  The Data Analyst uses a visualization platform to plot trends observed in the data. Professional Data Scientists and Citizen Data Scientists have the ability to build and train machine learning models using traditional and/or automated ML methods, and register and deploy the model for real-time inferencing. 

For clinical users, an informatics team at a hospital may be interested in building a customized clinical surveillance dashboard to observe nationwide trends for clinical adverse events. A patient may be interested in understanding their own risk for taking off-label drugs for symptomatic disease.  Finally, a physician can input patient characteristics into the model to assess drug risk, with the goal of providing the right therapy to the right patient at the right time.

## Prerequisites
To use this solution accelerator, you will need to have access to and/or provision the following applications:

1. Access to an [Azure Subscription ](http://portal.azure.com)
2. [Power Apps](http://www.powerapps.com) License (or free trial)
3. [PowerShell 7.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.1)
4. [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
5. [Databricks CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/)

A working knowledge of Azure, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Machine Learning, Azure Container Services, and PowerBI will also be helpful.  To learn more about these services, please visit:

3. [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/)
4. [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/)
5. [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/)
5. [PowerBI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/)


## Getting Started
1. An [ARM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) template deploys and configures all the resources required to run the solution.  Click the Deploy to Azure button below:

    [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fslsu0424%2FCOVID19-Drug-Therapies%2Fmain%2F02-Deployment%2Fcovid_azuredeploy.json)

    The only 2 required parameters during the set-up are:

    - **Admin Password** for the Synapse Dedicated SQL Pool being deployed.
    - **Prefix ID** to preface the resources with a unique name you can later reference.

2. Clone or download this repository and navigate to the project's root directory.

    Option 1: In Windows Terminal, clone the GitHub repo:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/slsu0424/COVID19-Drug-Therapies.git
      ```

    Option 2: Navigate towards the top right of this screen, and expand the **Code** button menu:

3. Go to the [Deployment Guide](./02-Deployment/Deployment.md) under [./02-Deployment](./02-Deployment) to complete the solution setup.

  > **NOTE**: Be sure to manually pause the SQL pool when you are not using it from the Synapse Workspace to reduce cost. Follow the steps below to pause the SQL pool:  
  > * Navigate to the Synapse workspace
  > *  Go to `Manage` > `SQL pools` > Pause the SQL pool
